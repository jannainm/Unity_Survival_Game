4 Zombie Motion Capture Animations - A free subset of Zombie animations for testing, to bring your undead game or CG project to life.
 

- All idles and transitions have been carefully pose-matched, for seamless motion trees.
- All animations are .fbx format, standard fbx bone names.
- Provided Motus Man Zombie character is copyright © Motus Digital, LLC

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If using these motion files in Unity 3D, setting the Rig to Humanoid will allow the animations to control another character.
Typical use would be "MotusMan_v2.fbx" as the main Avatar, and setting the animation files to copy its Avatar.

Please see the included tutorial for an explanation of getting started with a basic setup:
